abstract: We numerically study the dependence of the dynamics on the range of interaction
  Δ for the short-range square well potential. We find that, for small Δ, dynamics
  scale exactly in the same way as thermodynamics, both for Newtonian and Brownian
  microscopic dynamics. For interaction ranges from a few percent down to the Baxter
  limit, the relative location of the attractive-glass line and the liquid-gas line
  does not depend on Δ. This proves that, in this class of potentials, disordered
  arrested states (gels) can be generated only as a result of a kinetically arrested
  phase separation. © 2005 The American Physical Society.
