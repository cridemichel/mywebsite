abstract: The universal scaling between the average slow relaxation/transport and
  the average picosecond rattling motion inside the cage of the first neighbors has
  been evidenced in a variety of numerical simulations and experiments. Here, we first
  show that the scaling does not need information concerning the arbitrarily-defined
  glass transition region and relies on a single characteristic length scale a21/2
  which is determined even far from that region. This prompts the definition of a
  novel reduced rattling amplitude u21/2 which has been investigated by extensive
  molecular-dynamics simulations addressing the slow relaxation, the diffusivity,
  and the fast cage-dynamics of both components of an atomic binary mixture. States
  with different potential, density, and temperature are considered. It is found that
  if two states exhibit coinciding incoherent van Hove function on the picosecond
  timescale, the coincidence is observed at long times too, including the large-distance
  exponential decay-a signature of heterogeneous dynamics-observed when the relaxation
  is slow. A major result of the present study is that the correlation plot between
  the diffusivity of the two components of the binary mixtures and their respective
  reduced rattling amplitude collapse on the same master curve. This holds true also
  for the structural relaxation of the two components and the unique master curve
  coincides with the one of the average scaling. It is shown that the breakdown of
  the Stokes-Einstein law exhibited by the distinct atomic species of the mixture
  and the monomers of a chain in a polymer melt is predicted at the same reduced rattling
  amplitude. Finally, we evidence that the well-known temperature/density thermodynamic
  scaling of the transport and the relaxation of the mixture is still valid on the
  picosecond timescale of the rattling motion inside the cage. This provides a link
  between the fast dynamics and the thermodynamic scaling of the slow dynamics. Â©
