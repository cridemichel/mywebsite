abstract: We numerically investigate the competition between phase separation and
  dynamical arrest in a colloidal system interacting via a short-ranged attractive
  potential. Equilibrium fluid configurations are quenched at two different temperatures
  below the critical temperature and followed during their time evolution. At the
  lowest studied T, the phase-separation process is interrupted by the formation of
  an attractive glass in the dense phase. At the higher T, no arrest is observed and
  the phase-separation process proceeds endlessly in the simulated time window. The
  final structure of the glass retains memory of the interrupted phase-separation
  process in the form of a frozen spinodal decomposition peak, whose location and
  amplitude is controlled by the average packing fraction. We also discuss the time
  evolution of the nonergodicity parameter, providing evidence of a progressively
  decreasing localization length on increasing the packing fraction. Finally, we confirm
  that the reported results are independent of the microscopic dynamics. Â© 2005 American
