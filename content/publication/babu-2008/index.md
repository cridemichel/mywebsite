abstract: 'Hard spheres interacting through a square well potential were simulated
  by using two different methods: Brownian cluster dynamics (BCD) and event driven
  Brownian dynamics (EDBD). The structure of the equilibrium states obtained by both
  methods was compared and found to be almost identical. Self-diffusion coefficients
  (D) were determined as a function of the interaction strength. The same values were
  found by using BCD or EDBD. Contrary to EDBD, BCD allows one to study the effect
  of bond rigidity and hydrodynamic interaction within the clusters. When the bonds
  are flexible, the effect of attraction on D is relatively weak compared to systems
  with rigid bonds. D increases first with increasing attraction strength, and then
  decreases for stronger interaction. Introducing intracluster hydrodynamic interaction
  weakly increases D for a given interaction strength. Introducing bond rigidity causes
  a strong decrease in D which no longer shows a maximum as function of the attraction
  strength. Â© 2008 American Institute of Physics.'
