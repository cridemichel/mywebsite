abstract: An anisotropic colloidal shape in combination with an externally tunable
  interaction potential results in a plethora of self-assembled structures with potential
  applications toward the fabrication of smart materials. Here we present our investigation
  on the influence of an external magnetic field on the self-assembly of hematite-silica
  core--shell prolate colloids for two aspect ratios $h̊o$ = 2.9 and 3.69. Our study
  shows a rather counterintuitive but interesting phenomenon, where prolate colloids
  self-assemble into oblate liquid crystalline (LC) phases. With increasing concentration,
  particles with smaller $o̊$ reveal a sequence of LC phases involving para-nematic,
  nematic, smectic, and oriented glass phases. The occurrence of a smectic phase for
  colloidal ellipsoids has been neither predicted nor reported before. Quantitative
  shape analysis of the particles together with extensive computer simulations indicate
  that in addition to $r$̊, a subtle deviation from the ideal ellipsoidal shape dictates
  the formation of this unusual sequence of field-induced structures. Particles with
  $rh ̊= 2.9 exhibit a hybrid shape containing features from both spherocylinders
  and ellipsoids, which make their self-assembly behavior richer than that observed
  for either of the ``pure'' shapes. The shape of the particles with higher $ρm̊atches
  closely with the ideal ellipsoids, as a result their phase behavior follows the
  one expected for a ``pure'' ellipsoidal shape. Using anisotropic building blocks
  and external fields, our study demonstrates the ramifications of the subtle changes
  in the particle shape on the field-directed self-assembled structures with externally
  tunable properties.
