abstract: We investigate numerically pseudo-first-order irreversible bimolecular reactions
  of the type A + B → B between hard spheres undergoing event-driven Brownian dynamics.
  We study the encounter rate and the survival probability of A particles as functions
  of the packing fraction φ in the trapping (a single particle diffusing among static
  non-overlapping traps) and target (many traps diffusing in the presence of a single
  static target particle) settings, as well as in the case of diffusing traps and
  particles (full mobility). We show that, since inertial effects are accounted for
  in our simulation protocol, the standard Smoluchowski theory of coagulation of non-interacting
  colloids is recovered only at times greater than a characteristic time Δt, marking
  the transition from the under-damped to the over-damped regime. We show that the
  survival probability S(t) decays exponentially during this first stage, with a rate
  1/τ0 ∝ φ. Furthermore, we work out a simple analytical expression that is able to
  capture to an excellent extent the numerical results for t &lt; Δt at low and intermediate
  densities. Moreover, we demonstrate that the time constant of the asymptotic exponential
  decay of S(t) for diffusing traps and particles is , where kS = 4π(DA + DB)Rρ is
  the Smoluchowski rate. Detailed analyses of the effective decay exponent β = d [log(-logS(t))]/d
  (logt) and of the steady-state encounter rate reveal that the full mobility and
  trapping problem are characterized by very similar kinetics, rather different from
  the target problem. Our results do not allow one to ascertain whether the prediction
  S(t) ∝ exp(-at3/2) (a = const.) as t → ∞ for the trapping problem in 3D is indeed
  recovered. In fact, at high density, S(t) is dominated by short encounter times,
  which makes it exceedingly hard to record the events corresponding to the exploration
  of large, trap-free regions. As a consequence, at high densities the steady-state
  rate simply tends to 1/τ0. Finally, we work out an analytical formula for the rate
  that shows a remarkable agreement with the numerics up φ = 0.4. © 2013 IOP Publishing
