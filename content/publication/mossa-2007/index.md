abstract: The authors report Brownian dynamics simulation of the out-of-equilibrium
  dynamics (aging) in a colloidal suspension composed of rigid charged disks, one
  possible model for Laponite, a synthetic clay deeply investigated in the last few
  years by means of various experimental techniques. At variance with previous numerical
  investigations, mainly focusing on static structure and equilibrium dynamics, the
  authors explore the out-of-equilibrium aging dynamics. They analyze the wave vector
  and waiting time dependence of the dynamics, focusing on the single-particle and
  collective density fluctuations (intermediate scattering functions), the mean-squared
  displacement, and the rotational dynamics. Their findings confirm the complexity
  of the out-of-equilibrium dynamical behavior of this class of colloidal suspensions
  and suggest that an arrested disordered state driven by a repulsive Yukawa potential,
  i.e., a Wigner glass, can be observed in this model. Â© 2007 American Institute of
