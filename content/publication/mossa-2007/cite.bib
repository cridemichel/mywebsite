 abstract = {The authors report Brownian dynamics simulation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics (aging) in a colloidal suspension composed of rigid charged disks, one possible model for Laponite, a synthetic clay deeply investigated in the last few years by means of various experimental techniques. At variance with previous numerical investigations, mainly focusing on static structure and equilibrium dynamics, the authors explore the out-of-equilibrium aging dynamics. They analyze the wave vector and waiting time dependence of the dynamics, focusing on the single-particle and collective density fluctuations (intermediate scattering functions), the mean-squared displacement, and the rotational dynamics. Their findings confirm the complexity of the out-of-equilibrium dynamical behavior of this class of colloidal suspensions and suggest that an arrested disordered state driven by a repulsive Yukawa potential, i.e., a Wigner glass, can be observed in this model.
