abstract: We perform event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of a system composed
  by uniaxial hard ellipsoids for different values of the aspect ratio and packing
  fraction. We compare the molecular orientational-dependent structure factors previously
  calculated within the Percus-Yevick approximation with the numerical results. The
  agreement between theoretical and numerical results is rather satisfactory. We also
  show that, for specific orientational quantities, the molecular structure factors
  are sensitive to the particle shape and can be used to distinguish prolate from
  oblate ellipsoids. A first order theoretical expansion around the spherical shape
  and a geometrical analysis of the configurations confirms and explains such an observation.
