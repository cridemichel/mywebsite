abstract: If liquids, polymers, bio-materials, metals and molten salts can avoid crystallization
  during cooling or compression, they freeze into a microscopically disordered solid-like
  state, a glass. On approaching the glass transition, particles become trapped in
  transient cagesin which they rattle on picosecond timescalesformed by their nearest
  neighbours; the particles spend increasing amounts of time in their cages as the
  average escape time, or structural relaxation time α, increases from a few picoseconds
  to thousands of seconds through the transition. Owing to the huge difference between
  relaxation and vibrational timescales, theoretical studies addressing the underlying
  rattling process have challenged our understanding of the structural relaxation.
  Numerical and experimental studies on liquids and glasses support the theories,
  but not without controversies (for a review see ref.21). Here we show computer simulations
  that, when compared with experiments, reveal the universal correlation of the structural
  relaxation time (as well as the viscosity ) and the rattling amplitude from glassy
  to low-viscosity states. According to the emerging picture the glass softens when
  the rattling amplitude exceeds a critical value, in agreement with the Lindemann
  criterion for the melting of crystalline solids and the free-volume model. © 2008
