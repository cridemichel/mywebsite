abstract: 'Abstract: We put forward a theoretical framework to calculate pair distribution
  functions in the nematic liquid crystals formed by sphere-cylinders that self-assemble
  in linear chain structures. For a nematically ordered system, one can distinguish
  between the spatial correlations in the plane perpendicular to the crystalline axis,
  and in the direction parallel to the latter. Following this separation, we show
  that the RDFs in the parallel case can be described using a superposition of a chain
  model and Onsager distribution, whereas the RDFs in the perpendicular case turn
  out to be that of the soft disks. Based on this concept, we show how the spatial
  correlations in the system are influenced by the nematic order parameter. We conclude
  that even if the nematic ordering is high in the system, the imperfection of the
  crystal is strongly reflected in the pair distributions. Graphical abstract: [Figure
