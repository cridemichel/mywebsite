abstract: Nanometer-sized clusters are often targeted due to their potential applications
  as nanoreactors or storage/delivery devices. One route to assemble and stabilize
  finite structures consists in imparting directional bonding patterns between the
  nanoparticles. When only a portion of the particle surface is able to form an inter-particle
  bond, finite-size aggregates such as micelles and vesicles may form. Building on
  this approach, we combine particle shape anisotropy with the directionality of the
  bonding patterns and investigate the combined effect of particle elongation and
  surface patchiness on the low density assembly scenario. To this aim, we study the
  assembly of tip-functionalised Janus hard spherocylinder by means of Monte Carlo
  simulations. By exploring the effects of changing the interaction strength and range
  at different packing fractions, we highlight the role played by shape and bond anisotropy
  on the emerging aggregates (micelles, vesicles, elongated micelles, and lamellae).
  We observe that shape anisotropy plays a crucial role in suppressing phases that
  are typical to spherical Janus nanoparticles and that a careful tuning of the interaction
  parameters allows to promote the formation of spherical micelles. These finite-size
  spherical clusters composed of elongated particles might offer more interstitials
  and larger surface areas than those offered by micelles of spherical or almost-spherical
  units, thus enhancing their storage and catalytic properties.
