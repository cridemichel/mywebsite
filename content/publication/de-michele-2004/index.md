abstract: We address the question of the dependence of the fragility of glass forming
  supercooled liquids on the 'softness' of an interacting potential by performing
  numerical simulation of a binary mixture of soft spheres with different power n
  of the interparticle repulsive potential. We show that the temperature dependence
  of the diffusion coefficients for various n collapses onto a universal curve, supporting
  the unexpected view that fragility is not related to the hard core repulsion. We
  also find that the configurational entropy correlates with the slowing down of the
  dynamics for all studied n.
