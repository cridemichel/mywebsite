abstract: The rich and complex phase diagram typical of anisotropic biological or
  synthetic nanoparticles, has brought a great deal of interest over the equilibrium
  phase behaviour of non-spherical colloids. Amongst the class of anisotropic nanoparticles,
  hard spherocylindrical colloids have been, over the years, extensively studied because
  of their optical properties, for their rich phase diagrams, and their important
  industrial applications, as model particles for biological systems (viruses), or
  for example as potential drug carriers having the ability of surviving the attacks
  of the immune systems. As real anisotropic nanoparticles are often polydisperse
  in size and/or in shape, unveiling the effect of such a perturbation over their
  equilibrium phase diagram is of paramount importance. This work focuses on the effects
  of polydispersity over the full equilibrium phase diagram of hard spherocylindrical
  colloids (HSCs). Previous studies showed that a polydispersity in L alters the equilibrium
  phase diagram of HSCs. With this work we determine, both theoretically as well as
  computationally, the effects due to a generic polydispersity, namely in D, in L
  and, in both ones, on the equilibrium phase diagram and introduce a viable theoretical
  generalisation of the Onsager theory that allows us to get some insight into the
  observed phase behaviour.
