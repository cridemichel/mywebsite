 abstract = {The definitions of kinetic and thermodynamic fragility and their interrelations were discussed. The models for the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape (PEL) were analyzed. The relation between statistical properties of the landscape and fragility was described, building on the Adam-Gibbs relation, which connects structural relaxation times to configurational entropy. Two different possibilities for generating strong behavior were discussed.},
