 abstract = {An anisotropic colloidal shape in combination with an externally tuneable interaction potential results in a plethora of self-assembled structures with potential applications towards the fabrication of smart materials. Here we present our investigation on the influence of an external magnetic field on the self-assembly of hematite-silica core-shell ellipsoidal colloids for two aspect ratios ρ = 2.9 and 3.69. Our study shows a rather counter-intuitive but interesting phenomenon, where prolate colloids self-assemble into oblate liquid crystalline (LC) phases. With increasing concentration, particles with smaller ρ reveal a sequence of LC phases involving para-nematic, nematic, smectic and oriented glass phases. The occurrence of a smectic phase for colloidal ellipsoids has been neither predicted nor reported before. Quantitative shape analysis of the particles together with extensive computer simulations indicate that in addition to ρ, a subtle deviation from the ideal ellipsoidal shape dictates the formation of this unusual sequence of field-induced structures. Particles with ρ = 2.9 exhibit a hybrid shape containing features from both spherocylinders and ellipsoids, which make their self-assembly behavior richer than that observed for either of the ‘pure’ shapes. The shape of the particles with higher ρ matches closely with the ideal ellipsoids, as a result their phase behavior follows the one expected for a ‘pure’ ellipsoidal shape. Our study unequivocally demonstrates the power of combining anisotropic building blocks and external fields as a route towards field-directed self-assembly of novel structures with externally tuneable properties together with the ramifications that the subtle changes in the particle shape have on the resulting self-assembled structures.},
