abstract: The globular protein γB-crystallin exhibits a complex phase behavior, where
  liquid-liquid phase separation characterized by a critical volume fraction øc =
  0.154 and a critical temperature Tc = 291.8 K coexists with dynamical arrest on
  all length scales at volume fractions around ø ≈ 0.3-0.35, and an arrest line that
  extends well into the unstable region below the spinodal. However, although the
  static properties such as the osmotic compressibility and the static correlation
  length are in quantitative agreement with predictions for binary liquid mixtures,
  this is not the case for the dynamics of concentration fluctuations described by
  the dynamic structure factor S(q,t). Using a combination of dynamic light scattering
  and neutron spin echo measurements, we demonstrate that the competition between
  critical slowing down and dynamical arrest results in a much more complex wave vector
  dependence of S(q,t) than previously anticipated. © 2015 American Chemical Society.
