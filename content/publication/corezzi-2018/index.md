abstract: Autocatalysis, i.e., the speeding up of a reaction through the very same
  molecule which is produced, is common in chemistry, biophysics, and material science.
  Rate-equation-based approaches are often used to model the time dependence of products,
  but the key physical mechanisms behind the reaction cannot be properly recognized.
  Here, we develop a patchy particle model inspired by a bicomponent reactive mixture
  and endowed with adjustable autocatalytic ability. Such a coarse-grained model captures
  all general features of an autocatalytic aggregation process that takes place under
  controlled and realistic conditions, including crowded environments. Simulation
  reveals that a full understanding of the kinetics involves an unexpected effect
  that eludes the chemistry of the reaction, and which is crucially related to the
  presence of an activation barrier. The resulting analytical description can be exported
  to real systems, as confirmed by experimental data on epoxy-amine polymerizations,
  solving a long-standing issue in their mechanistic description. Â© 2018 The Author(s).
