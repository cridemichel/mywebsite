abstract: 'Biological liquid crystals, originating from the self-assembly of biological
  filamentous colloids, such as cellulose and amyloid fibrils, show a complex lyotropic
  behaviour that is extremely difficult to predict and characterize. Here we analyse
  the liquid crystalline phases of amyloid fibrils, and sulfated and carboxylated
  cellulose nanocrystals and measure their Frank-Oseen elastic constants K1, K2 and
  K3 by four different approaches. The first two approaches are based on the benchmark
  of the predictions of: (i) a scaling form and (ii) a variational form of the Frank-Oseen
  energy functional with the experimental critical volumes at orderâ€“order liquid crystalline
  transitions of the tactoids. The third and the fourth methods imply: (iii) the direct
  scaling equations of elastic constants and (iv) a molecular theory predicting the
  elastic constants from the experimentally accessible contour length distributions
  of the filamentous colloids. These three biological systems exhibit diverse liquid
  crystalline behaviour, governed by the distinct elastic constants characterizing
  each colloid. Differences and similarities among the three systems are highlighted
  and interpreted based on the present analysis, providing a general framework to
  study dispersed liquid crystalline systems.'
