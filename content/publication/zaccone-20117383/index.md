abstract: In the diffusion model of chemical reactions, the encounter (reaction) rate
  between reactant particles is governed by the Smoluchowski equation, which is a
  diffusion equation in a field of forces. We consider crowded environments where
  the particles diffuse through a \"liquid\" of like particles. Assuming that the
  liquid-like short-range structure around the reactant gives rise to an effective
  (osmotic) barrier leads us to map a complicated many-body problem to a one-dimensional
  problem. This allows us to describe theoretically such complex systems that are
  encountered in many applications where crowding, intermolecular interactions, and
  flow are simultaneously present. A particularly important effect is discovered which
  is due to the interplay between shear and crowding. This effect is responsible for
  unexpected peaks in the reactivity at low flow intensity which may explain, among
  other things, the bizarre colloidal stability behavior of concentrated protein suspensions.
