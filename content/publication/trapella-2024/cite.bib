 abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated the self-assembly and long-range ordering of concentrated aqueous solutions of DNA and RNA mononucleotides. These are found to form Watsonâ€“Crick pairs that stack into columns that become spatially organized into a columnar liquid-crystalline phase. In this work, we numerically investigate this phase behavior by adopting an extremely coarse-grained model in which nucleotides are represented as semi-disk-like polyhedra decorated with attractive (patchy) sites that mimic the stacking and pairing interactions. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations of these patchy polyhedra by adapting algorithms borrowed from computer graphics. This model reproduces the features of the experimental phase behavior, which essentially depends on the combination of pairing and stacking interactions.},
