abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated the self-assembly and long-range ordering
  of concentrated aqueous solutions of DNA and RNA mononucleotides. These are found
  to form Watsonâ€“Crick pairs that stack into columns that become spatially organized
  into a columnar liquid-crystalline phase. In this work, we numerically investigate
  this phase behavior by adopting an extremely coarse-grained model in which nucleotides
  are represented as semi-disk-like polyhedra decorated with attractive (patchy) sites
  that mimic the stacking and pairing interactions. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations
  of these patchy polyhedra by adapting algorithms borrowed from computer graphics.
  This model reproduces the features of the experimental phase behavior, which essentially
  depends on the combination of pairing and stacking interactions.
