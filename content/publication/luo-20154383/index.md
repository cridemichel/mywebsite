abstract: We present a general approach based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics for
  bridging the gap between a well-defined microscopic model and the macroscopic rheology
  of particle-stabilised interfaces. Our approach is illustrated by starting with
  a microscopic model of hard ellipsoids confined to a planar surface, which is intended
  to simply represent a particle-stabilised fluid-fluid interface. More complex microscopic
  models can be readily handled using the methods outlined in this paper. From the
  aforementioned microscopic starting point, we obtain the macroscopic, constitutive
  equations using a combination of systematic coarse-graining, computer experiments
  and Hamiltonian dynamics. Exemplary numerical solutions of the constitutive equations
  are given for a variety of experimentally relevant flow situations to explore the
  rheological behaviour of our model. In particular, we calculate the shear and dilatational
  moduli of the interface over a wide range of surface coverages, ranging from the
  dilute isotropic regime, to the concentrated nematic regime. © The Royal Society
