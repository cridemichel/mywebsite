 abstract = {The correlation between the fast cage dynamics and structural relaxation is investigated in a model polymer system. It is shown that the cage vibration amplitude, as expressed by the Debye-Waller factor, and the relaxation time collapse on a single universal curve with a simple analytic form when the temperature, the density, the chain length and the monomer-monomer interaction potential are changed. For the physical states with the same the coincidence of the mean-square displacement, the intermediate scattering function and the non-Gaussian parameter is observed in a wide time window spanning from the ballistic regime to the onset of the Rouse dynamics driven by the chain connectivity. The role of the non-Gaussian effects is discussed. Â© 2008 Taylor & Francis.},
