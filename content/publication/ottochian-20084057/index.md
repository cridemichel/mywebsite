abstract: The correlation between the fast cage dynamics and structural relaxation
  is investigated in a model polymer system. It is shown that the cage vibration amplitude,
  as expressed by the Debye-Waller factor, and the relaxation time collapse on a single
  universal curve with a simple analytic form when the temperature, the density, the
  chain length and the monomer-monomer interaction potential are changed. For the
  physical states with the same the coincidence of the mean-square displacement, the
  intermediate scattering function and the non-Gaussian parameter is observed in a
  wide time window spanning from the ballistic regime to the onset of the Rouse dynamics
  driven by the chain connectivity. The role of the non-Gaussian effects is discussed.
