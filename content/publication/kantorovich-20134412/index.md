abstract: We put forward a theoretical approach to analyse the structure factors obtained
  experimentally for solutions of self-assembling anisotropic particles. This method
  is applicable for any system of particles forming chains in thermodynamic equilibrium
  and is based on studying the behaviour of the centre-centre structure factor first
  peak. In order to calculate the structure factor analytically, we first derive the
  radial distribution function. For that we use the combination of the density functional
  theory and density expansion of the pair correlation functions. The first theory
  allows for the equilibrium chain formation, and the second takes into account particles'
  shape anisotropy at the level of the Gay-Berne potential. We apply our method to
  describe centre-centre structure factors of self-assembling short DNA duplexes with
  various semiaxes ratios. Extensive comparison of the theoretical predictions with
  the Monte Carlo simulation data shows a very good agreement. We show that the particle
  shape anisotropy exerts a crucial influence on the behaviour of the structure factors.
