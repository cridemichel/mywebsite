abstract: We investigate the kinetics of self-assembly by means of Brownian dynamics
  simulation based on a idealized fluid model (two 'sticky' spots on a sphere) in
  which the particles are known to form into dynamic polymer chains at equilibrium.
  To illustrate the slow evolution of the properties of these self-assembling fluids
  to their equilibrium assembled state values at long times, we perform Brownian dynamics
  simulations over a range of quench depths from the high temperature unassembled
  state to the low temperature assembled state. We investigate the time dependence
  of the average chain length (cluster mass), the order parameter for the assembly
  transition (fraction of particles in the chain state) and the potential energy of
  the fluid. The rate constant governing the self-assembly ordering process depends
  both on kinetic-related factors (the particle hydrodynamic radius and the fluid
  viscosity) and on thermodynamic energetic variables governing the self-assembly
  transition (i.e., the entropy and enthalpy of assembly). We provide evidence that
  an essentially parameter-free description of the polymerization kinetics can be
  formulated for this model. Â© 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.
