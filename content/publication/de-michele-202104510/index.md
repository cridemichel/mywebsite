abstract: Abstract Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments exhibit noncovalent attractive
  interactions between their tips. It is still unclear how DNA liquid crystal self-assembly
  is affected by such blunt-end attractions. It is demonstrated that stiff dsDNA fragments
  with moderate aspect ratio can specifically self-assemble in concentrated aqueous
  solutions into different types of smectic mesophases on the basis of selectively
  screening of blunt-end DNA stacking interactions. To this end, this type of attractions
  are engineered at the molecular level by constructing DNA duplexes where the attractions
  between one or both ends are screened by short hairpin caps. All-DNA bilayer and
  monolayer smectic-A type of phases, as well as a columnar phase, can be stabilized
  by controlling attractions strength. The results imply that the so far elusive smectic-A
  in DNA rod-like liquid crystals is a thermodynamically stable phase. The existence
  of the bilayer smectic phase is confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations of hard cylinders
  decorated with one attractive terminal site. This work demonstrates that DNA blunt-ends
  behave as well-defined monovalent attractive patches whose strength and position
  can be potentially precisely tuned, highlighting unique opportunities concerning
  the stabilization of nonconventional DNA-based lyotropic liquid crystal phases assembled
  by all-DNA patchy particles with arbitrary geometry and composition.
