abstract: The analysis of realistic numerical simulations of a gel-forming irreversible
  aggregation process provides information on the role of cluster diffusion in controlling
  the late stages of the aggregation kinetics. Interestingly, the crossover from chemically
  controlled to diffusion-controlled aggregation takes place well beyond percolation,
  after most of the particles have aggregated in the spanning network and only small
  clusters remain in the sol. The simulation data are scrutinized to gain insight
  into the origin of this crossover. We show that a single additional time scale (related
  to the average diffusion time) is sufficient to provide an accurate description
  of the evolution of the extent of reaction at all times. Â© 2010 American Chemical
