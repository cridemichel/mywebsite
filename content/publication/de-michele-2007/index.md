abstract: We study the dynamics of monodisperse hard ellipsoids via a new event-driven
  molecular dynamics algorithm as a function of volume fraction and aspect ratio X0.
  We evaluate the translational Dtrans and the rotational Drot diffusion coefficients
  and the associated isodiffusivity lines in the X0 plane. We observe a decoupling
  of the translational and rotational dynamics which generates an almost perpendicular
  crossing of the Dtrans and Drot isodiffusivity lines. While the self-intermediate
  scattering function exhibits stretched relaxation, i.e., glassy dynamics, only for
  large and X0≈1, the second order orientational correlator C2(t) shows stretching
  only for large and small X0 values. We discuss these findings in the context of
  a possible prenematic order driven glass transition. © 2007 The American Physical
