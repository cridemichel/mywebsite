abstract: 'Abstract.: Liquid-crystalline phases in all-DNA systems have been extensively
  studied in the past and although nematic, cholesteric and columnar mesophases have
  been observed, the smectic phase remained elusive. Recently, it has been found evidence
  of a smectic-A ordering in an all-DNA system, where the constituent particles, which
  are gapped DNA duplexes, resemble chain-sticks. It has been argued that in the smectic-A
  phase these DNA chain-sticks should be folded as a means to suppress aggregate polydispersity
  and excluded volume. Nevertheless, if initial crystalline configurations are prepared
  in silico with gapped DNA duplexes either fully unfolded or fully folded by carrying
  out computer simulations one can end up with two different phases having at the
  same concentration and temperature the majority of gapped DNA duplexes either folded
  or unfolded. This result suggests that these two phases have a small free energy
  difference, since no transition is observed from one to the other within the simulation
  time span. In the present manuscript, we assess which of these two phases is thermodynamically
  stable through a suitable protocol based on thermodynamic integration. Our method
  is rather general and it can be used to discriminate stable states from metastable
  ones of comparable free energy. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
