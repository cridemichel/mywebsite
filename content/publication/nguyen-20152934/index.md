abstract: Short cylinder-like DNA duplexes, comprising 6 to 20 base pairs, self-assemble
  into semi-flexible chains, due to coaxial stacking interactions between their blunt
  ends. The mutual alignment of these chains gives rise to macroscopically orientationally
  ordered liquid crystal phases. Interestingly, experiments show that the isotropic-nematic
  phase boundary is sequence-dependent. We perform all-atom simulations of several
  sequences to gain insights into the structural properties of the duplex and correlate
  the resulting geometric properties with the observed location of the isotropic-nematic
  phase boundary. We identify in the duplex bending the key parameter for explaining
  the sequence dependence, suggesting that DNA duplexes can be assimilated to bent-core
  mesogens. We also develop a coarse-grained model for the different DNA duplexes
  to evaluate in detail how bending affects the persistence length and excluded volume
  of the aggregates. This information is fed into a recently developed formalism to
  predict the isotropic-nematic phase boundary for bent-core mesogens. The theoretical
  results agree with the experimental observations. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry.2015.
