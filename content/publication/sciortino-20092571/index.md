abstract: We study, via Brownian dynamics simulation, the kinetics of formation of
  branched loop-less structures for a mixture of particles with functionalities of
  two and three, the three-functional ones providing the branching points in the resulting
  network. We show that for this system, by combining the appropriate Smoluchowski
  rate equations, including condensation and fragmentation terms, with the thermodynamic
  perturbation theory of Wertheim, it is possible to provide a parameter-free description
  of the assembly process, even in the limit of irreversible aggregation (low T).
  Our work provides evidence of a connection between physical and chemical gelation
  in low-valence particle systems, properly relating aging (or curing) time with temperature.
