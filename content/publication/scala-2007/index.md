abstract: Brownian dynamics algorithms integrate Langevin equations numerically and
  allow to probe long time scales in simulations. A common requirement for such algorithms
  is that interactions in the system should vary little during an integration time
  step; therefore, computational efficiency worsens as the interactions become steeper.
  In the extreme case of hard-body interactions, standard numerical integrators become
  ill defined. Several approximate schemes have been invented to handle such cases,
  but little emphasis has been placed on testing the correctness of the integration
  scheme. Starting from the two-body Smoluchowski equation, the authors discuss a
  general method for the overdamped Brownian dynamics of hard spheres, recently developed
  by one of the authors. They test the accuracy of the algorithm and demonstrate its
  convergence for a number of analytically tractable test cases. Â© 2007 American Institute
