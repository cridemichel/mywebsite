 abstract = {The transport and the relaxation properties of a biatomic supercooled liquid are studied by molecular-dynamics methods. Both translational and rotational jumps are evidenced. At lower temperatures their waiting-time distributions decay as a power law at short times. The Stokes-Einstein relation (SE) breaks down at a temperature which is close to the onset of the intermittency. A precursor effect of the SE breakdown is observed as an apparent stick-slip transition. The breakdown of Debye-Stokes-Einstein law for rotational motion is also observed. On cooling, the changes of the rotational correlation time τ1 and the translational diffusion coefficient at low temperatures are fitted by power laws over more than three and four orders of magnitude, respectively. A less impressive agreement is found for τl with l = 2 - 4 and the rotational diffusion coefficient.},
