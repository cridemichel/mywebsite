abstract: The transport and the relaxation properties of a biatomic supercooled liquid
  are studied by molecular-dynamics methods. Both translational and rotational jumps
  are evidenced. At lower temperatures their waiting-time distributions decay as a
  power law at short times. The Stokes-Einstein relation (SE) breaks down at a temperature
  which is close to the onset of the intermittency. A precursor effect of the SE breakdown
  is observed as an apparent stick-slip transition. The breakdown of Debye-Stokes-Einstein
  law for rotational motion is also observed. On cooling, the changes of the rotational
  correlation time τ1 and the translational diffusion coefficient at low temperatures
  are fitted by power laws over more than three and four orders of magnitude, respectively.
  A less impressive agreement is found for τl with l = 2 - 4 and the rotational diffusion
  coefficient.
