abstract: Hard helices can be regarded as a paradigmatic elementary model for a number
  of natural and synthetic soft matter systems, all featuring the helix as their basic
  structural unit, from natural polynucleotides and polypeptides to synthetic helical
  polymers, and from bacterial flagella to colloidal helices. Here we present an extensive
  investigation of the phase diagram of hard helices using a variety of methods. Isobaric
  Monte Carlo numerical simulations are used to trace the phase diagram; on going
  from the low-density isotropic to the high-density compact phases a rich polymorphism
  is observed, exhibiting a special chiral screw-like nematic phase and a number of
  chiral and/or polar smectic phases. We present full characterization of the latter,
  showing that they have unconventional features, ascribable to the helical shape
  of the constituent particles. Equal area construction is used to locate the isotropic-to-nematic
  phase transition, and the results are compared with those stemming from an Onsager-like
  theory. Density functional theory is also used to study the nematic-to-screw-nematic
  phase transition; within the simplifying assumption of perfectly parallel helices,
  we compare different levels of approximation, that is second- and third-virial expansions
  and a Parsons-Lee correction. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
