abstract: Concentrated solutions of short blunt-ended DNA duplexes, as short as 6
  base pairs, are known to order into the nematic liquid crystal phases. This self-assembly
  is due to the stacking interactions between duplex terminals that promotes their
  aggregation into polydisperse chains with a significant persistence length. Experiments
  show that liquid crystal phases form above a critical volume fraction depending
  on the duplex length. We introduce and investigate via numerical simulations, a
  coarse-grained model of DNA double-helical duplexes. Each duplex is represented
  as an hard quasi-cylinder whose bases are decorated with two identical reactive
  sites. The stacking interaction between terminal sites is modeled via a short-range
  square-well potential. We compare the numerical results with predictions based on
  a free energy functional and find satisfactory quantitative matching of the isotropic-nematic
  phase boundary and of the system structure. Comparison of numerical and theoretical
  results with experimental findings confirm that the DNA duplex self-assembly can
  be properly modeled via equilibrium polymerization of cylindrical particles. This
  insight enables us to estimate the stacking energy. Â© 2011 American Chemical Society.
