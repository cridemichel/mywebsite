abstract: We study a system of uniaxial hard ellipsoids by molecular dynamics simulations,
  changing both the aspect-ratio X0 (X0 = a/b, where a is the length of the revolution
  axis and b is the length of the two other axes) and the packing fraction ø. We calculate
  the translational 〈r2(t)〉 and rotational 〈Φ2(t)〉 mean squared displacements, the
  translational Dtrans and the rotational Drot diffusion coefficients and the associated
  isodiffusivity lines in the ø- X0 plane. For the first time, we characterize the
  cage effect through the logarithmic time derivative of logr2(t) and log2(t). These
  quantities exhibit a minimum if the system is supercooled and we show that, consistently
  with our previous findings, for large and small X0 values, rotations are supercooled,
  contrary to translations. In agreement with this scenario, while the self-intermediate
  scattering function exhibits stretched relaxation (i.e. glassy dynamics) only for
  large and X0 1, the second order orientational correlator C2(t) show stretching
  only for large and small X0 values. As further evidence of this pre-nematic order
  driven glass transition, we observe a decoupling of the translational and rotational
  dynamics, which generates an almost perpendicular crossing of the Dtrans and Drot
  isodiffusivity lines. © 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis.
