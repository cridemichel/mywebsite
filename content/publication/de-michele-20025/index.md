abstract: Generation of equilibrium configurations is the major obstacle for numerical
  investigation of the slow dynamics in supercooled liquid states. The parallel tempering
  (PT) technique, originally proposed for the numerical equilibration of discrete
  spin-glass model configurations, has recently been applied in the study of supercooled
  structural glasses. We present an investigation of the ability of parallel tempering
  to properly sample the liquid configuration space at different temperatures, by
  mapping the PT dynamics into the dynamics of the closest local potential energy
  minima (inherent structures). Comparing the PT equilibration process with the standard
  molecular dynamics equilibration process we find that the PT does not increase the
  speed of equilibration of the (slow) configurational degrees of freedom. © 2002
