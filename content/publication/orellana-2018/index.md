abstract: 'Abstract.: The hard cylinder model decorated with attractive patches proved
  to be very useful recently in studying physical properties of several colloidal
  systems. Phase diagram, elastic constants and cholesteric properties obtained from
  computer simulations based on a simple hard cylinder model have been all successfully
  and quantitatively compared to experimental results. Key to these simulations is
  an efficient algorithm to check the overlap between hard cylinders. Here, we propose
  two algorithms to check the hard cylinder overlap and we assess their efficiency
  through a comparison with an existing method available in the literature and with
  the well-established algorithm for simulating hard spherocylinders. In addition,
  we discuss a couple of optimizations for performing computer simulations of patchy
  anisotropic particles and we estimate the speed-up which they can provide in the
  case of patchy hard cylinders. Â© 2018, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany,
