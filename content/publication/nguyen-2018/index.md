abstract: 'Abstract.: Anisotropic interactions can bring about the formation, through
  self-assembly, of semi-flexible chains, which in turn can give rise to nematic phases
  for suitable temperatures and concentrations. A minimalist model constituted of
  hard cylinders decorated with attractive sites has been already extensively studied
  numerically. Simulation data shows that a theoretical approach recently proposed
  is able to properly capture the physical properties of these self-assembly-driven
  liquid crystals. Here, we investigated a simpler model constituted of bifunctional
  Kern-Frenkel hard spheres which does not possess steric anisotropy but which can
  undergo a istropic-nematic transition as a result of their self-assembly into semi-flexible
  chains. For this model we compare an accurate numerical estimate of isotropic-nematic
  phase boundaries with theoretical predictions. The theoretical treatment, originally
  proposed for cylinder-like particles, has been greatly simplified and its predictions
  are in good agreement with numerical results. Finally, we also assess a crucial,
  and not obvious, hypothesis used in the theory, i.e. the ability of the Onsager
  trial function to properly model particle orientation in the presence of aggregation,
  that has not been properly checked yet. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available:
