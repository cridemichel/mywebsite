abstract: Several physical systems in condensed matter have been modeled approximating
  their constituent particles as hard objects. The hard spheres model has been indeed
  one of the cornerstones of the computational and theoretical description in condensed
  matter. The next level of description is to consider particles as rigid objects
  of generic shape, which would enrich the possible phenomenology enormously. This
  kind of modeling will prove to be interesting in all those situations in which steric
  effects play a relevant role. These include biology, soft matter, granular materials
  and molecular systems. With a view to developing a general recipe for event-driven
  molecular dynamics simulations of hard rigid bodies, two algorithms for calculating
  the distance between two convex hard rigid bodies and the contact time of two colliding
  hard rigid bodies solving a non-linear set of equations will be described. Building
  on these two methods, an event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for simulating
  systems of convex hard rigid bodies will be developed and illustrated in details.
  In order to optimize the collision detection between very elongated hard rigid bodies,
  a novel nearest-neighbor list method based on an oriented bounding box will be introduced
  and fully explained. Efficiency and performance of the new algorithm proposed will
  be extensively tested for uniaxial hard ellipsoids and superquadrics. Finally applications
  in various scientific fields will be reported and discussed. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.
