abstract: We report event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of the irreversible
  gelation of hard ellipsoids of revolution containing several associating groups,
  characterizing how the cluster size distribution evolves as a function of the extent
  of reaction, both below and above the gel point. We find that over a very large
  interval of values of the extent of reaction, parameter-free mean-field predictions
  are extremely accurate, providing evidence that in this model the Ginzburg zone
  near the gel point, where non-mean field effects are important, is very limited.
  We also find that the Flory's hypothesis for the post-gelation regime properly describes
  the connectivity of the clusters even if the long-time limit of the extent of reaction
  does not reach the fully reacted state. This study shows that irreversibly aggregating
  asymmetric hard-core patchy particles may provide a close realization of the mean-field
  model, for which available theoretical predictions may help control the structure
  and the connectivity of the gel state. Besides chemical gels, the model is relevant
  to network-forming soft materials like systems with bioselective interactions, functionalized
  molecules and patchy colloids. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry.
