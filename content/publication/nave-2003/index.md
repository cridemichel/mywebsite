abstract: The techniques which allow the numerical evaluation of the statistical properties
  of the potential energy landscape for models of simple liquids are reviewed and
  critically discussed. Expressions for the liquid free energy and its vibrational
  and configurational components are reported. Finally, a possible model for the statistical
  properties of the landscape, which appears to describe correctly fragile liquids
  in the region where equilibrium simulations are feasible, is discussed.
