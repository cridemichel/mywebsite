abstract: ' For generating an isobaric–isothermal ensemble in molecular dynamics simulations
  of atomic systems a correct ensemble distribution can be obtained by the approach
  of Martyna, Tobias and Klein [J. Chem. Phys. 101, 4177–4189 (1994)]. The constituting
  equations of the latter approach have been also generalised to molecular systems
  [M. E. Tuckerman, Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation, Oxford
  Graduate Texts (2010)] using the molecular virial instead of the atomic one. An
  isothermal–isobaric method for systems with holonomic molecular constraints has
  been also introduced in the past [G. Kalibaeva, M. Ferrario and G. Ciccotti, Mol.
  Phys. 101 765–778 (2003)] but the factorisation was not worked out completely, resulting
  in a non-reversible first-order algorithm. Here, we propose the correct factorisation
  and implement a reversible integrator based on Martyna, Tobias and Klein equations
  for a system of molecules subjected to holonomic constraints. We add to the algorithm
  the Suzuki–Yoshida treatment that improves the energy conservation or permits to
  go to larger time steps. Finally, we test our algorithm by applying it to the dynamics
  of a Ortotherphenyl model. '
