abstract: We report a numerical investigation of the viscoelastic behavior in models
  for steric repulsive and short-ranged attractive colloidal suspensions, along different
  paths in the attraction strength vs packing fraction plane. More specifically, we
  study the behavior of the viscosity (and its frequency dependence) on approaching
  the repulsive glass, the attractive glass, and in the reentrant region where viscosity
  shows a nonmonotonic behavior on increasing attraction strength. On approaching
  the glass lines, the increase of the viscosity is consistent with a power-law divergence
  with the same exponent and critical packing fraction previously obtained for the
  divergence of the density fluctuations. Based on mode-coupling calculations, we
  associate the increase of the viscosity with specific contributions from different
  length scales. We also show that the results are independent of the microscopic
  dynamics by comparing Newtonian and Brownian simulations for the same model. Finally,
  we evaluate the Stokes-Einstein relation approaching both glass transitions, finding
  a clear breakdown which is particularly strong for the case of the attractive glass.
