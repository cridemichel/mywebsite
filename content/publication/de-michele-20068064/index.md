abstract: 'We report extensive Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations
  of a liquid composed of particles interacting via hard-sphere interactions complemented
  by four tetrahedrally coordinated short-range attractive (\"sticky\") spots, a model
  introduced several years ago by Kolafa and Nezbeda (Kolafa, J.; Nezbeda, I. Mol.
  Phys. 1987, 87, 161). To access the dynamic properties of the model, we introduce
  and implement a new event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm suited to study the
  evolution of hard bodies interacting, beside the repulsive hard-core, with a short-ranged
  interpatch square well potential. We evaluate the thermodynamic properties of the
  model in deep supercooled states, where the bond network is fully developed, providing
  evidence of density anomalies. Different from models of spherically symmetric interacting
  particles, the liquid can be supercooled without encountering the gas-liquid spinodal
  in a wide region of packing fractions φ. Around an optimal φ, a stable fully connected
  tetrahedral network of bonds develops. By analyzing the dynamics of the model we
  find evidence of anomalous behavior: around the optimal packing, dynamics accelerate
  on both increasing and decreasing φ. We locate the shape of the isodiffusivity lines
  in the (φ - T) plane and establish the shape of the dynamic arrest line in the phase
  diagram of the model. Results are discussed in connection with colloidal dispersions
  of sticky particles and gel-forming proteins and their ability to form dynamically
  arrested states. © 2006 American Chemical Society.'
