 abstract = {We report extensive Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of a liquid composed of particles interacting via hard-sphere interactions complemented by four tetrahedrally coordinated short-range attractive ("sticky") spots, a model introduced several years ago by Kolafa and Nezbeda (Kolafa, J.; Nezbeda, I. Mol. Phys. 1987, 87, 161). To access the dynamic properties of the model, we introduce and implement a new event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm suited to study the evolution of hard bodies interacting, beside the repulsive hard-core, with a short-ranged interpatch square well potential. We evaluate the thermodynamic properties of the model in deep supercooled states, where the bond network is fully developed, providing evidence of density anomalies. Different from models of spherically symmetric interacting particles, the liquid can be supercooled without encountering the gas-liquid spinodal in a wide region of packing fractions φ. Around an optimal φ, a stable fully connected tetrahedral network of bonds develops. By analyzing the dynamics of the model we find evidence of anomalous behavior: around the optimal packing, dynamics accelerate on both increasing and decreasing φ. We locate the shape of the isodiffusivity lines in the (φ - T) plane and establish the shape of the dynamic arrest line in the phase diagram of the model. Results are discussed in connection with colloidal dispersions of sticky particles and gel-forming proteins and their ability to form dynamically arrested states. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},
