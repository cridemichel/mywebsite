abstract: In this paper we introduce a fully flexible coarse-grained model of immunoglobulin
  G (IgG) antibodies parametrized directly on cryo-EM data and simulate the binding
  dynamics of many IgGs to antigens adsorbed on a surface at increasing densities.
  Moreover, we work out a theoretical model that allows to explain all the features
  observed in the simulations. Our combined computational and theoretical framework
  is in excellent agreement with surface-plasmon resonance data and allows us to establish
  a number of important results. (i) Internal flexibility is key to maximize bivalent
  binding, flexible IgGs being able to explore the surface with their second arm in
  search for an available hapten. This is made clear by the strongly reduced ability
  to bind with both arms displayed by artificial IgGs designed to rigidly keep a prescribed
  shape. (ii) The large size of IgGs is instrumental to keep neighboring molecules
  at a certain distance (surface repulsion), which essentially makes antigens within
  reach of the second Fab always unoccupied on average. (iii) One needs to account
  independently for the thermodynamic and geometric factors that regulate the binding
  equilibrium. The key geometrical parameters, besides excluded-volume repulsion,
  describe the screening of free haptens by neighboring bound antibodies. We prove
  that the thermodynamic parameters govern the low-antigen-concentration regime, while
  the surface screening and repulsion only affect the binding at high hapten densities.
  Importantly, we prove that screening effects are concealed in relative measures,
  such as the fraction of bivalently bound antibodies. Overall, our model provides
  a valuable, accurate theoretical paradigm beyond existing frameworks to interpret
  experimental profiles of antibodies binding to multi-valent surfaces of different
  sorts in many contexts. Â© 2016 De Michele et al.
