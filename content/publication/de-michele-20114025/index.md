abstract: In glassy dynamics, the rattling of particles in a cage formed by their
  neighbors is typically limited to a length scale of the order of the particle diameter
  but is nevertheless strongly coupled to the overall structural arrest of the system
  (solidification). Furthermore, the rattling amplitude and the structural relaxation
  time have been recently shown to follow the same scaling form in various polymer
  melts and supercooled liquids. In this paper we analyze from this perspective for
  the first time the glassy dynamics emerging from the formation of a persistent network
  in a model colloidal gel at very low density. The structural relaxation time of
  the gel network is compared with the mean squared displacement at short times, corresponding
  to the localization length associated to the presence of energetic bonds. Interestingly,
  we find that the same type of scaling as for the dense glassy systems holds. Our
  findings elucidate the strong coupling between the cooperative rearrangements of
  the gel network and the single particle localization in the structure, and support
  the general nature of the scaling proposed. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.
