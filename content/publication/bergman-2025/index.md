abstract: Attempts to use colloid science concepts to better understand the dynamic
  properties of concentrated or crowded protein solutions are challenging due to the
  fact that globular proteins generally have heterogeneous surfaces that result in
  anisotropic or patchy contributions to their interaction potential. This is particularly
  difficult when targeting non-equilibrium transitions such as glass and gel formation
  in concentrated protein solutions. Here we report a systematic study of the reduced
  zero shear viscosity ηr of the globular protein γB-crystallin, an eye lens protein
  that plays a vital role in vision-related phenomena such as cataract formation or
  presbyopia, and compare the results to the existing structural and dynamic data.
  Combining two different tracer particle-based microrheology methods allows us to
  precisely locate the line of kinetic arrest within the phase diagram and characterize
  the functional form of the concentration and temperature dependence of ηr. We show
  that while our results qualitatively confirm the existing view that this protein
  can be reasonably well described using a coarse-grained picture of a patchy colloid
  with short range attractions, there are a number of novel findings that cannot easily
  be understood with the existing simple colloid models. We demonstrate in particular
  the complete failure of an extended law of corresponding states for a description
  of the temperature dependence of the arrest line, and discuss the role that transient
  clusters play in this context.
