abstract: Concentrated solutions of short blunt-ended DNA duplexes at room temperature
  can form liquid crystal phases due to stacking interactions between duplex terminals
  which induce the aggregation of the duplexes into semi-flexible linear chains. Mesophases
  observed in these systems include nematic, columnar and cholesteric ones. This experimental
  system is just one of many examples, where liquid crystals ordering emerges as a
  result of molecular self-assembly into linear chains. In the attempt to go beyond
  a simple Onsager theoretical approach to understand the thermodynamic behavior of
  this system, we introduced some years ago a general theoretical description, which
  models the isotropic-nematic transition by properly taking into account molecular
  self-assembly, and we carefully verified the theoretical predictions against numerical
  simulations of patchy hard cylinders. Here, we provide a revised version of the
  theory in the attempt of understanding which assumptions are worth to be improved.
  In particular, we focus on the Parsons-Lee approximation and the modeling of orientational
  entropy. We compare the results from the revised version of the theory against original
  ones, showing that the present version of the theory is able to capture more accurately
  the phase boundaries of the isotropic-nematic transition. © 2019, © 2019 Informa
