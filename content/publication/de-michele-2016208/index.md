abstract: Unveiling the subtle rules that control the buildup of macroscopic chirality
  starting from chiral molecular elements is a challenge for theory and computations.
  In this context, a remarkable phenomenon is the formation of helically twisted nematic
  (cholesteric) phases, with pitch in the micrometer range, driven by self-assembly
  of relatively small chiral species into supramolecular semiflexible polymers. We
  have developed a theoretical framework to connect the cholesteric organization to
  the shape and chirality of the constituents, described with molecular detail, in
  this kind of system. The theory has been tested against new accurate measurements
  for solutions of short DNA duplexes. We show that the cholesteric organization is
  determined by steric repulsion between duplexes, and we identify distinctive features
  of linear self-assembly in the temperature and concentration dependence of the pitch.
