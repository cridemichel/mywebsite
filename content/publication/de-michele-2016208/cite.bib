 abstract = {Unveiling the subtle rules that control the buildup of macroscopic chirality starting from chiral molecular elements is a challenge for theory and computations. In this context, a remarkable phenomenon is the formation of helically twisted nematic (cholesteric) phases, with pitch in the micrometer range, driven by self-assembly of relatively small chiral species into supramolecular semiflexible polymers. We have developed a theoretical framework to connect the cholesteric organization to the shape and chirality of the constituents, described with molecular detail, in this kind of system. The theory has been tested against new accurate measurements for solutions of short DNA duplexes. We show that the cholesteric organization is determined by steric repulsion between duplexes, and we identify distinctive features of linear self-assembly in the temperature and concentration dependence of the pitch. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},
