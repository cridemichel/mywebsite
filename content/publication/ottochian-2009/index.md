abstract: On approaching the glass transition, the microscopic kinetic unit spends
  increasing time rattling in the cage of the first neighbors, whereas its average
  escape time, the structural relaxation time τα, increases from a few picoseconds
  up to thousands of seconds. A thorough study of the correlation between τα and the
  rattling amplitude, expressed by the Debye-Waller factor, was carried out. Molecular-dynamics
  simulations of both a model polymer system and a binary mixture were performed by
  varying the temperature, the density ρ, the potential and the polymer length to
  consider the structural relaxation as well as both the rotational and the translation
  diffusion. The present simulations, together with MD studies on other glassformers,
  evidence the scaling between the structural relaxation and the caged dynamics. An
  analytic model of the master curve is developed in terms of two characteristic length
  scales ̄a2 1/2 and σa 21/2, pertaining to the distance to be covered by the kinetic
  unit to reach a transition state. The model does not imply τα divergences. The comparison
  with the experiments supports the numerical evidence over a range of relaxation
  times as wide as about eighteen orders of magnitude. A comparison with other scaling
  and correlation procedures is presented. In particular, the density scaling of the
  length scales ̄a2 1/2, σa21/2 ρ -1/3 is shown to be not supported by the present
  simulations. The study suggests that the equilibrium and the moderately supercooled
  states of the glassformers possess key information on the huge slowing-down of their
  relaxation close to the glass transition. The latter, according to the present simulations,
  exhibits features consistent with the Lindemann melting criterion and the free-volume
  model. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.
