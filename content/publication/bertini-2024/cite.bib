 abstract = {Telomeric G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical DNA structures composed of TTAGGG repeats. They are extensively studied both as biomolecules key for genome stability and as promising building blocks and functional elements in synthetic biology and nanotechnology. This is why it is extremely important to understand how the interaction between G4s is affected by their topology. We used small-angle x-ray scattering to investigate the end-to-end stacking of antiparallel telomeric G-quadruplexes formed by the sequence AG3(T2AG3)3. To represent the experimental data, we developed a highly efficient coarse-grained fitting tool, which successfully described the samples as an equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric G4 species. Our findings indicate that the antiparallel topology prevents the formation of long multimeric structures under self-crowding conditions, unlike the hybrid/parallel structures formed by the same DNA sequence. This result supports the idea that the stacking of monomeric G-quadruplexes is strongly affected by the presence of diagonal loops.},
