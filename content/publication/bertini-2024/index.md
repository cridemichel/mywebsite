abstract: Telomeric G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical DNA structures composed
  of TTAGGG repeats. They are extensively studied both as biomolecules key for genome
  stability and as promising building blocks and functional elements in synthetic
  biology and nanotechnology. This is why it is extremely important to understand
  how the interaction between G4s is affected by their topology. We used small-angle
  x-ray scattering to investigate the end-to-end stacking of antiparallel telomeric
  G-quadruplexes formed by the sequence AG3(T2AG3)3. To represent the experimental
  data, we developed a highly efficient coarse-grained fitting tool, which successfully
  described the samples as an equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric G4 species.
  Our findings indicate that the antiparallel topology prevents the formation of long
  multimeric structures under self-crowding conditions, unlike the hybrid/parallel
  structures formed by the same DNA sequence. This result supports the idea that the
  stacking of monomeric G-quadruplexes is strongly affected by the presence of diagonal
  loops.
