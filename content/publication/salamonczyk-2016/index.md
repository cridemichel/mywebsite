abstract: Smectic ordering in aqueous solutions of monodisperse stiff double-stranded
  DNA fragments is known not to occur, despite the fact that these systems exhibit
  both chiral nematic and columnar mesophases. Here, we show, unambiguously, that
  a smectic-A type of phase is formed by increasing the DNA's flexibility through
  the introduction of an unpaired single-stranded DNA spacer in the middle of each
  duplex. This is unusual for a lyotropic system, where flexibility typically destabilizes
  the smectic phase. We also report on simulations suggesting that the gapped duplexes
  (resembling chain-sticks) attain a folded conformation in the smectic layers, and
  argue that this layer structure, which we designate as smectic-fA phase, is thermodynamically
  stabilized by both entropic and energetic contributions to the system's free energy.
  Our results demonstrate that DNA as a building block offers an exquisitely tunable
  means to engineer a potentially rich assortment of lyotropic liquid crystals. Â©
