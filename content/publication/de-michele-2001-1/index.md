abstract: The transport and relaxation properties of a molecular supercooled liquid
  on an isobar are studied by molecular dynamics. The molecule is a rigid heteronuclear
  biatomic system. The diffusivity is fitted over four orders of magnitude by the
  power law [formula presented] with [formula presented] and [formula presented] The
  self-part of the intermediate scattering function [formula presented] exhibits a
  steplike behavior at the lowest temperatures. On cooling, the increase of the related
  relaxation time [formula presented] tracks the diffusivity, i.e., [formula presented]
  At the lowest temperatures, fractions of highly mobile and trapped molecules are
  also evidenced. Translational jumps are also evidenced. The duration of the jumps
  exhibits a distribution. The distribution of the waiting times before a jump takes
  place, [formula presented] is exponential at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures
  a power-law divergence is evidenced at short times, [formula presented] with [formula
  presented] which is ascribed to intermittency. The shear viscosity is fitted by
  the power law [formula presented] with [formula presented] at the lowest temperatures.
  At higher temperatures the Stokes-Einstein relation fits the data if stick boundary
  conditions are assumed. The product [formula presented] increases at lower temperatures,
  and the Stokes-Einstein relation breaks down at a temperature which is close to
  the one where the intermittency is evidenced by [formula presented] A precursor
  effect of the breakdown is observed, which manifests itself as an apparent stick-slip
  transition. Â© 2001 The American Physical Society.
