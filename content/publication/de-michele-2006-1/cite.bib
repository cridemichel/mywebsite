 abstract = {We report extensive Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of the fluid and liquid phase of a primitive model for silica recently introduced by Ford [J. Chem. Phys. 121, 8415 (2004)]. We evaluate the isodiffusivity lines in the temperature-density plane to provide an indication of the shape of the glass transition line. Except for large densities, arrest is driven by the onset of the tetrahedral bonding pattern and the resulting dynamics is strong in Angell's classification scheme [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 131-133, 13 (1991)]. We compare structural and dynamic properties with corresponding results of two recently studied primitive models of network forming liquids-a primitive model for water and an angular-constraint-free model of four-coordinated particles-to pin down the role of the geometric constraints associated with bonding. Eventually we discuss the similarities between "glass" formation in network forming liquids and "gel" formation in colloidal dispersions of patchy particles. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},
