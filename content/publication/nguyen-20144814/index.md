abstract: The anisotropy of attractive interactions between particles can favor, through
  a self-assembly process, the formation of linear semi-flexible chains. In the appropriate
  temperatures and concentration ranges, the growing aspect ratio of the aggregates
  can induce formation of a nematic phase, as recently experimentally observed in
  several biologically relevant systems. We present here a numerical study of the
  isotropic-nematic phase boundary for a model of bifunctional polymerizing hard cylinders,
  to provide an accurate benchmark for recent theoretical approaches and to assess
  their ability to capture the coupling between self-assembly and orientational ordering.
  The comparison indicates the importance of properly modeling excluded volume and
  orientational entropy and provides a quantitative confirmation of some theoretical
  predictions. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
