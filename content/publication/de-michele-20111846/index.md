abstract: Event-driven molecular dynamics is a valuable tool in condensed and soft
  matter physics when particles can be modeled as hard objects or more generally if
  their interaction potential can be modeled in a stepwise fashion. Hard spheres model
  has been indeed widely used both for the computational and theoretical description
  of physical systems. Recently further developments of computational techniques allow
  simulations of hard rigid objects of generic shape. In the present paper we will
  present some optimizations for event-driven simulations that offered a significant
  speedup over previous methods. In particular we will describe a generalization of
  the well-known linked cell list method and an improvement on the nearest neighbor
  list method recently proposed by us. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
