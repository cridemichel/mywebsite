abstract: Diffusion-limited reactions are commonly found in biochemical processes
  such as enzyme catalysis, colloid and protein aggregation and binding between different
  macromolecules in cells. Usually, such reactions are modeled within the Smoluchowski
  framework by considering purely diffusive boundary problems. However, inertial effects
  are not always negligible in real biological or physical media on typical observation
  time frames. This is all the more so for non-bulk phenomena involving physical boundaries,
  that introduce additional time and space constraints. In this paper, we present
  and test a novel numerical scheme, based on event-driven Brownian dynamics, that
  allows us to explore a wide range of velocity relaxation times, from the purely
  diffusive case to the underdamped regime. We show that our algorithm perfectly reproduces
  the solution of the Fokker-Planck problem with absorbing boundary conditions in
  all the regimes considered and is thus a good tool for studying diffusion-guided
  reactions in complex biological environments. Â© 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.
