abstract: Hydrogen hydrates are among the basic constituents of our solar systemâ€™s
  outer planets, some of their moons, as well Neptune-like exo-planets. The details
  of their high-pressure phases and their thermodynamic conditions of formation and
  stability are fundamental information for establishing the presence of hydrogen
  hydrates in the interior of those celestial bodies, for example, against the presence
  of the pure components (water ice and molecular hydrogen). Here, we report a synthesis
  path and experimental observation, by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements,
  of the most H2-dense phase of hydrogen hydrate so far reported, namely the compound
  3 (or C3). The detailed characterisation of this hydrogen-filled ice, based on the
  crystal structure of cubic ice I (ice Ic), is performed by comparing the experimental
  observations with first-principles calculations based on density functional theory
  and the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We observe that the extreme
  (up to 90 GPa and likely beyond) pressure stability of this hydrate phase is due
  to the close-packed geometry of the hydrogen molecules caged in the ice Ic skeleton.
