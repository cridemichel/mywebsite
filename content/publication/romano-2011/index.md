abstract: Recently, a simple scaling argument was introduced that allows us to map,
  with some precautions, Brownian and Monte Carlo dynamics for spherical particles.
  Here, we extend the scaling to study systems that have orientational degrees of
  freedom and carefully asses its validity over a wide region of temperature and density.
  Our work allows us to devise a Brownian Monte Carlo algorithm that produces, to
  a good approximation, physically meaningful trajectories with a minimum programming
  effort, although at the expense of some sampling efficiency. Â© 2011 American Institute
