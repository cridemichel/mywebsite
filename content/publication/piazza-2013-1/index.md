abstract: In the real world, diffusion-limited reactions in chemistry and biology
  mostly occur in crowded environments, such as macromolecular complex formation in
  the cell. Despite the paramount importance of such phenomena, theoretical approaches
  still mainly rely on the Smoluchowski theory, only valid in the infinite dilution
  limit. In this paper we introduce a novel theoretical framework to describe the
  encounter rate and the stationary density profiles for encounters between an immobilized
  target and a fluid of interacting spherical particles, valid in the local density
  approximation. A comparison with numerical simulations performed for a fluid of
  hard spheres and square well attractive hard spheres confirms the accuracy of our
  treatment. Â© 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.
