abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm to perform event-driven simulations of hard
  rigid bodies of arbitrary shape, that relies on the evaluation of the geometric
  distance. In the case of a monodisperse system of uniaxial hard ellipsoids, we perform
  molecular dynamics simulations varying the aspect-ratio X0 and the packing fraction
  . We evaluate the translational Dtrans and the rotational Drot diffusion coefficient
  and the associated isodiffusivity lines in the -X0 plane. We observe a decoupling
  of the translational and rotational dynamics which generates an almost perpendicular
  crossing of the Dtrans and Drot isodiffusivity lines. While the self intermediate
  scattering function exhibits stretched relaxation, i.e. glassy dynamics, only for
  large and X0≈1, the second order orientational correlator C2(t) shows stretching
  only for large and small X0 values. We discuss these findings in the context of
  a possible pre-nematic order driven glass transition. © 2008 American Institute
