abstract: We report molecular dynamics simulations of a gel-forming mixture of ellipsoidal
  patchy particles with different functionality. We show that in this model, which
  disfavors the formation of bond-loops, elapsed time during irreversible aggregation-leading
  to the formation of an extended network-can be formally correlated with equilibrium
  temperature in reversible aggregation. We also show that it is possible to develop
  a parameterfree description of the self-assembly kinetics, bringing reversible and
  irreversible aggregation of loopless branched systems to the same level of understanding
  as equilibrium polymerization. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.
