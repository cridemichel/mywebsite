abstract: We discuss features of simple inter-particle potentials which are able to
  generate low-packing fraction arrested states, i.e. gels, in the absence of a macroscopic
  phase separation phenomenon. We suggest that the ratio between surface and bulk
  free energy is crucial in favoring ideal gel states. Two possible models for gels,
  one based on the competition of short range attraction and long range repulsions
  and the other on local constraints disfavoring packed local structures are discussed.
