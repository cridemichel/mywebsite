abstract: We report extensive Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations
  of the fluid and liquid phase of a primitive model for silica recently introduced
  by Ford [J. Chem. Phys. 121, 8415 (2004)]. We evaluate the isodiffusivity lines
  in the temperature-density plane to provide an indication of the shape of the glass
  transition line. Except for large densities, arrest is driven by the onset of the
  tetrahedral bonding pattern and the resulting dynamics is strong in Angell's classification
  scheme [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 131-133, 13 (1991)]. We compare structural and dynamic
  properties with corresponding results of two recently studied primitive models of
  network forming liquids-a primitive model for water and an angular-constraint-free
  model of four-coordinated particles-to pin down the role of the geometric constraints
  associated with bonding. Eventually we discuss the similarities between \"glass\"
  formation in network forming liquids and \"gel\" formation in colloidal dispersions
  of patchy particles. Â© 2006 American Institute of Physics.
